# Jiancheng Li

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at USC, and I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from UC Santa Cruz. My background and experience involve working with full-stack applications, large language models, and AI agents. 

I have a strong passion for building innovative platforms and tools that enhance productivity and better serve the community. I'm also particularly interested in information retrieval with vector databases and exploring solutions that combine both retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic AI to enhance question-answering tasks in specific domains.
